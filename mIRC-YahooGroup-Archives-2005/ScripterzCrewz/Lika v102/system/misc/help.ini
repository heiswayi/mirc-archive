Themes include modified fonts, display (whois, connected!) and modified Channel displays (such as Join/Parts).

Icons, commands, and style are among the things edited. $crlf $crlf To add icon simply right-click and select the "Add" Button. From there you have 2 options: You may add another icon or add a break/seperator (|).  If you want to add a icon, type in the path, tooltip and the command.

1=The central utility that allows you to configure options for your friends, family or other users. Features include Auto Op, Auto Voice, ShitList, and Auto Protect. The Userlist is configured by Address not nickname thus making it more safer and customizable. $crlf $crlf To add an Address, simply press the 'Add' Button. Type in the address, the channels, and select a 'level(see definitions of levels below)' for the user. You cannot edit the level or channels once the address is added. So to change the channels/level simple remove the address and add a new one.
2=$crlf $crlf The user's address is essential because it verifies  that the nickname matches the address you specify before the commands take effect. So you don't  Ops or Voice the wrong person. So Try to be specific when specifying the address.  The default is Nick!*@* this is based on nick of the user and is not recommended. Try to use wildcards, $crlf $crlf *Examples: $crlf Nick*!*@*.columbia.sc.da.uu.net $crlf *!username@*.aol.com $crlf  $crlf $+ > Add - Add a user to the userlist $crlf $+ > Rem - Removes the selected user from the userlist.

[word replacer]
1=A very nifty feature and personally one of my favorites. This features turns a combination of letter or numbers into a word or sentence. For Instance 'lol" into 'Laughing Out Loud.' It Supports an unlimited amount of words. This Word replacer is state of the art, lol. It uses 'reptok' instead of 'replace' so it won't ruin words.  $crlf $crlf *Example, If I was replacing 'io' with "Im out": $crlf $+ err school, well io <- That would replace. $crlf $+ Today i have Biology <- That would NOT replace.
2=$crlf $crlf To add a new word to the list, simply press "New". Then fill in the the corresponding text boxes and press the add button.
