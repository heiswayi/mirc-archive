<b>about:</b><Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lika, Formerly known as [webirc],  first started out in 2001 as a few simple /say aliases and has advanced throughout alot these past two years. Today 
Lika is a simple, semi-advanced mIRC script for version 6.16+. Lika utilizes the most recent scripting advancements (ha): MTS Theme System, MDX.dll, popups.dll, and ktools.dll etc.. <Br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This script has been on my HD for quite some time now. I have worked on it over the last four summers during HIghschool. And i never released it. So i figured id release and put it to some purpose.
<Br><Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lika originally started out as my [Nalika] personal script. So i decided to release, for all the lazy people out there. 
Lika is maintained and scripted by Nalika. <Br><br>
