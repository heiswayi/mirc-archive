Cyborg Script is a mIRC script intended to make your IRC life easier.  The whole set up of this script is specially made For IRC DALnet server. Script features are channel protection, personal protection, such as floods, kick, etc., cool away system, mp3 player, agent spy bot, and this script contains a built in bot mode. I wrote some bot commands and it has a auto talk in query and channel. All I can say is this is the most complete script that I ever made and hopefully you might like it to use.

About Me:
My name is aditya...I am an Indonesian 20 years old live in Jakarta, scripting is only one of my hobbiies. I started scripting 2 years ago..when i met a philipino scripter who interested in war scripting. We then formed a team comprises of 5 scripters. All other members are philipinos except me...P~. We at the time created some series of war scripts namely [|BestwaR|]. I myself have been creating BestwaR-X edition series, perfection, generationX, Generation-Next series, Cyborg series, Perawan, and [ARMAGEDDON]. Most of the scripts are War/revenge addon scripts, and Only perawan and cyborg have a full scrpt version. As suggested by ANdI_In_AcTiON, we then presently form a new team consisting of Indonesians only the [ARMAGEDDON] team.   

Disclaimer:
Do not change/rip/modify/reproduce this script. This is free and use it at your own risk. Anything that may happen to your computer is not my problem.
